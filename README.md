# Weather App

A weather app that I created as a part of The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum. It allows you to check the weather during the day in any location, so you are always prepared for any situation :D.

### Features

1. Check out the current weather conditions in any city
2. Get information about temperature, humidity, clouds and UV index
3. Observe the weather change every hour of the day
4. Toggle between different temperature modes
5. Enjoy the design of the page

### What I learned

It was a fascinating journey and during all this time I learned:

- what asynchronous JS is and how to work with it
- how to grab desired information from an API
- any complex task is not as difficult as you think, especially if you break it down into smaller pieces _(frontend page design seemed abnormally tough to me, but this principle helped me to overcome it XD)_

### Technologies
